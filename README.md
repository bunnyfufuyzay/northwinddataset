# Northwind Traders Business Analysis using PostgreSQL

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the **Northwind Traders dataset** using PostgreSQL. It simulates real-world business analysis tasks through SQL queries that uncover insights on customers, products, employees, and suppliers. The project aims to replicate what business analysts do dailyâ€”turning raw data into clear insights that support decision-making.

## Objectives

1. **Understand business performance** through customer, product, and sales analysis.
2. **Apply SQL** for data cleaning, aggregation, and analytical reporting.
3. **Identify patterns** that show growth, churn, and efficiency opportunities.
4. **Build a foundation** for visual dashboards and executive reports.

## SQL Analysis & Business Questions

Below are 20 practical SQL questions with their corresponding queries and notes.

---

### 1. Who are our top customers in terms of number of orders (not revenue)?
```sql
SELECT
    company_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS total_orders
FROM customers AS c
JOIN orders AS o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY company_name
ORDER BY total_orders DESC
LIMIT 5;
-- Identifies repeat customers by total order count.
```

JOIN orders AS o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.company_name
